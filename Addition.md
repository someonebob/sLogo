Estimation: before looking at the old code:
        how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
        I think it will take about 2 hours
        how many files will you need to add or update? Why?
        I will need to display the stamps in the front-end (1 file), make a new class to represent the command (1 file), possibly make changes to the InstructionData class (1 file), and make a class for Stamp (1 file). In total, I will need to add/update 3-4 files.
