###Before looking at the old code (Friday May 5)

**How long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?**

In all honesty, both of the possible additions for this assignment are in realms of the project I didn't work on. We split our team into the following parts:

1. Interpretation (ME)
2. Instruction (MATT)
3. Front-end (JESSE & JIMMY)

The add-ons feel into the latter two categories. 

Being back-end, I have decided to do the additional instructions, because I am at least somewhat familiar with the back-end architecture. 

I can make the following guesses for time management:
1. Reading over instruction hierarchy (20 minutes)
2. Reading over relevant front-end display like drawing the pen (40 minutes; unfamiliar code)
3. Adding to the views to allow Actors to keep track of stamps (an hour; unfamiliar code)
4. Adding the new instructions in the instruction package (30 minutes)
5. Looking for bugs (an hour)

This sums to a total of **3 1/2 hours.**

**How many files will you need to add or update? Why?**

I will need to completely add the following:

1. A *Stamp* instruction
2. A *Clearstamp* instruction
3. Some sort of view in the frontend for stamps (StampView?)

Likewise, I will probably have to add code to display stamps on the screen/update them. This will depend upon how the front-end implement displays/updates.

I would estimate the total number of files changed or added as **4 files.**
