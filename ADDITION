Slogo Addition
==============

###Estimation: before looking at the old code:
1 hour
2 files, add a view class, update in controller.

###Review: after completing the feature:
1 hour
Updated 3 files, had to tie it to the SimulationView to connect the actors.
It took me a few tries and I had to refamiliarize myself with the code.

###Analysis: what do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation?
It isn't as good as I remembered. It should've been simpler to add to the preferencesView but there were too many dependencies tied together and on image updating wouldn't update another image somewhere else and it was a mess to deal with. I ended up replaing our original preferencesView for the additional view.
It would've been manageable if I didn't know the code but would've taken maybe an extra hour.
